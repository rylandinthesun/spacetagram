### Overview

This challenge was fun and just assured my love for Front End Development. I kept it pretty simple with animations and layout which I think helped with givin it an easy and understandle user experience.

### What I learend

I actually spent a decent amount of time figuring out the functions for the like button. It works mostly how it should with adding/saving to the localstorage but if the home feed was static, and the user went back to it from their like page, then the like button would be 'unliked' even when it's in your likes. That's because I'm seperating the feed of what I'm getting from the API with the localstorage data of 'liked' objects.
